# Title: Simple Number Squaring Application

## Description:
* This project creates a basic web application using Gradio that allows users to input a number and receive its square as the output. It demonstrates a fundamental use case of Gradio for quickly building interactive interfaces for Python functions.

## Responsibilities:
#### 1.User Input: 
The application is responsible for accepting numerical input from the user.
#### 2.Calculation: 
It performs the mathematical operation of squaring the input number.
#### 3.Output Display: 
It displays the calculated square to the user.
#### 4.Interface Management: 
Gradio handles the creation and management of the web interface.

## Library:
### Gradio (gr): 
* This is the core library used for building the interactive web interface. Gradio simplifies the process of creating user interfaces for machine learning models and Python functions.

## Summary:
* This project is a minimal example of using Gradio to create a web application. It defines a Python function square_number that calculates the square of a given number. Then, it uses gr.Interface to wrap this function with a user-friendly web interface. The interface takes a number as input and displays the squared result as output. Finally, interface.launch() starts a local web server, making the application accessible through a browser.
